# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. 

It is a comprehensive Twitter clone built using React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a rich user interface with features such as posts, user profiles, search functionality, and customizable appearance settings. 

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
